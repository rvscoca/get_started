# Get started !
Create your own EC2 instance -
EC2 is the AWS service that allows you to create and manage virtual servers in the AWS cloud.

You don't need to know anything about networking (subnets, availibility zones, routing and stuff like that), so don't be afraid.
For the moment, you just need to create an instance, and be able to connect to it with ssh.

# Step 1 :
- Launch an AWS EC2 instance, following this tutorial : 

!IMPORTANT!
CHOOSE A RED HAT LINUX ENTERPRISE AMI (the free one)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html (in french because i'm nice)

After doing this (it's ok if it takes time), you are now able to connect to your virtual server thanks to your ssh key.
You can connect with PuTTY (a free software) or just with a regular terminal.

Note : you will find all the informations (ip adress, domain name, username...) of your instance on the instance management dashboard,
in the EC2 section.

!IMPORTANT!
After using your EC2 instance, don't forget to STOP IT ! Otherwise you will be charged.

# Step 2 :
- Update packages
- Install git

# Step 3 : 
- Install python3
- Install pip

# Step 4 : 
- Install zsh
- Install Oh-my-zsh
- Intall tmux (terminal multiplexer)

### CONGRATULATIONS IF YOU SUCCEED ! :)
