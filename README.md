# Get started !
Create your own EC2 instance -
EC2 is the AWS service that allows you to create and manage virtual server in the AWS cloud.

# Step 1 :
- Launch an AWS EC2 instance, following this tutorial : 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html (in french because i'm nice)

After doing this (it's ok if it takes time), you are now able to connect to your virtual server with your ssh key.
You can connect with PuTTY or a regular terminal.

# Step 2 :
- Update packages
- Install git

# Step 3 : 
- Install python3
- Install pip

# Step 4 : 
- Install zsh
- Install Oh-my-zsh
